#Write a program using a while statement, that given an integer as input, prints all the integers starting 
# from 1 up to but not including that number. Print one number per line.
#For example if the input is
#4
#the output should be:
#1
#2
#3

num = int(input("Input an int: ")) # Do not change this line
count = 1
while count < num:
        print(count)
        count += 1
